# Effort Management System (EMS) - .NET Backend

The **Effort Management System (EMS)** is a backend solution designed to efficiently manage the allocation, tracking, and optimization of effort within organizations and projects. Built using **ASP.NET Core**, this system helps project managers and team leads monitor resource usage, track time spent on tasks, and optimize the distribution of effort across projects.

## Key Features
- **Time Tracking**: Provides endpoints for logging the time spent on various tasks to track effort and performance.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allows the allocation of tasks based on team members' availability and skill set.
- **Effort Analysis and Reporting**: Includes endpoints to generate detailed reports and analytics to evaluate efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and optimize future projects.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user management and role-based access control using **ASP.NET Identity**.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes a RESTful API that can be consumed by front-end applications or other services.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core (for handling business logic, API development, and database interactions)
- **Database**: SQL Server or Entity Framework Core (for managing and storing data)
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Identity (for user authentication and role management)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger (for easy API documentation and testing)
- **Reporting**: Integration with Telerik or Crystal Reports (for generating detailed reports)

## Benefits
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Helps teams allocate effort and tasks based on real-time availability and skill sets.
- **Comprehensive Time Tracking**: Track the amount of time spent on each task and generate useful reports for analysis.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale, making it suitable for both small and large teams or organizations.
- **Security**: Built with **ASP.NET Core Identity** for secure authentication and role-based access control.
